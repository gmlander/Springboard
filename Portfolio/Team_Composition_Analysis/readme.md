### Problem Definition and Intended Audience

This analysis evaluates game data from professional level _League of Legends_ (LoL) matches to find prredictors, patterns, and models that may aid a franchise in making pregame strategy decisions in regards to style of play and team composition, both generally and opponent-specifically. As the intended audience is a professional team, this analysis does not make much effort in explaining endemic terminology of the game. For a primer see [here](http://www.espn.com/esports/story/_/id/14545779/guide-league-legends) or [here](https://www.riftherald.com/2016/9/29/13027318/lol-guide-how-to-watch-play-intro).

The main impediment to analyzing League, or eSports in general, in the same manner as a traditional sport, is that it isn't one. Obviously. But it's an important thing to remember. Athletes canâ€™t change their physical strengths and weaknesses from game to game, but League players can and do (or at least their champion's). So how does one predict the effectiveness of a team when its compositional elements are indefinite? That's the question this analysis hopes to answer, through machine learning techniques to bucketize and map the many different observed champion-playstyle combinations into a few discrete, interprettable archetypes that can be used as easily inform drafting/banning decisions.
