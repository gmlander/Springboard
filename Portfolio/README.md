## About

This repository holds portfolio projects I worked on while completing Springboard's Data Science Career Track program.

### Projects

- *Team Composition Analysis*: A study of professional *League of Legends* games, aimed at finding a handful of unique patterns in the playstyles of thousands of players, and using those patterns to better understand how different teams play the game as a whole.
- *Evaluation of Player Performance*: A study of professional *League of Legends* players, using the results of my previous project to create artificial reference points for individual players in order to assess how much they help or hurt their teams, without all the noise of roles and team resource allocation getting the way.
