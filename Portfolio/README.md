## About

This repository holds portfolio projects I worked on while completing Springboard's Data Science Career Track program.

### Projects

- [*Team Composition Analysis*](https://github.com/gmlander/Springboard/tree/master/Portfolio/Team_Composition_Analysis): A study of professional *League of Legends* games, aimed at finding a handful of unique patterns in the playstyles of thousands of players, and using those patterns to better understand how different teams play the game as a whole.
- [*Computer Vision with Hyper-Ensembling*](https://github.com/gmlander/Springboard/tree/master/Portfolio/Computer_Vision_With_Boosted_Augmentation): This project is an attempt to create a more robust method for ensembling through fitting a Neural Network on the predictions of multiple models on sets of transformed images, built using data from the
[iMaterialist](https://www.kaggle.com/c/imaterialist-challenge-furniture-2018) competition on kaggle.

#### Other Projects

Code and writeups hosted on Mode Analytics at the link provided. Topics examined include:
